Valuation by lots/serial numbers
================================

Track :doc:`inventory valuation <using_inventory_valuation>` by :doc:`lots or serial numbers
<../../product_management/product_tracking>` to:

#. Compare and differentiate purchasing cost based on lot/SN.
#. Track the actual cost of manufactured products based on the real cost of each tracked component
   used.
#. Depreciate specific lots/SNs when they :doc:`sit in stock for too long
   <../../warehouses_storage/reporting/aging>`.

Configuration
=============

To enable valuation by lots or serial numbers, begin by enabling the :ref:`Lots and Serial Numbers
feature <inventory/product_management/enable-lot-serial>`. After that, go to
:menuselection:`Inventory app --> Products --> Products` and select the desired product.

On the product form, in the :guilabel:`Category` field, choose a product category. Then, choose the
:icon:`oi-arrow-right` :guilabel:`(right arrow)` icon to open the product category's settings page.
In the :guilabel:`Inventory Valuation` section, choose the desired :guilabel:`Costing Method`.

.. seealso::
   :ref:`Costing methods <inventory/warehouses_storage/valuation-on-product-category>`

After configuring the costing method, activate the product to be tracked by lots or serial numbers
by ticking the :guilabel:`Track Inventory` checkbox. Then, click the field that becomes visible and
choose either :guilabel:`By Lots` or :guilabel:`By Unique Serial Number` from the resulting
drop-down menu.

Doing so makes the :guilabel:`Valuation by Lot/Serial number` checkbox appear below it. Tick it, and
the configuration to track valuation by lot or serial numbers is complete.

Valuation layers
================

To understand how this valuation method works, consider how the following scenarios influence the
valuation of a lot/serial number:

#. Purchase and selling products: cost is updated according to the costing method set on the
   *product category*. For more information, refer to the :ref:`Costing Methods section
   <inventory/warehouses_storage/costing_methods>`
#. Inventory adjustment to existing lot/serial number: cost = cost of the last layer of this lot
#. Inventory adjustment to create new lot/serial number: cost = cost from product form

View valuation
==============

Valuations of a lot/serial number can be viewed through the valuation report or through the
lot/serial number form page.

Valuation report
----------------

Display the valuation of lots and serial numbers in the database by going to
:menuselection:`Inventory app --> Reporting --> Valuation`.

On the :guilabel:`Stock Valuation` report, click the search bar, and in the :guilabel:`Group By`
section of the resulting drop-down menu, select :guilabel:`Lot/Serial number`.

.. tip::
   Click the :icon:`fa-plus` :guilabel:`(+)` icon to the right of a collapsed lot number line to
   :ref:`manually modify the cost <inventory/warehouses_storage/update-unit-price>`.

   This is useful for adjusting individual lot prices when a purchase order or bill includes
   multiple lots/serial numbers, as initial prices are identical upon reception.
